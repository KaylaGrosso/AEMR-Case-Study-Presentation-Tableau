# American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) Case Study

## Project Overview
In this project, I conducted an analysis of the energy market trends to address key concerns regarding energy stability, outages, and losses in the industry. Using SQL queries and Tableau for data visualization, I explored data to derive actionable insights that would help improve energy systems and regulatory frameworks. The project involved cleaning and processing data, generating reports, and visualizing key findings to support data-driven decisions in energy policy.

### Key Insights and Visualizations
- **Energy Stability**: Trends in energy usage across various sectors and regions, identifying peak demand periods.
- **Outage Patterns**: Analysis of outage occurrences and their impact on the grid.
- **Energy Losses**: Understanding the correlation between energy loss and infrastructure aging, weather patterns, and other variables.
  
The final findings were summarized into an interactive Tableau dashboard, showcasing key metrics and insights from the analysis.

## Files Included
### 1. **SQL Analysis (Jupyter Notebook)**
The SQL queries for data analysis are provided in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file). These queries were used to process and analyze the raw energy market data. You can access and view the SQL notebook [here](https://anaconda.cloud/share/notebooks/32dd162e-93ac-4bb1-833c-3b5797cba54f/overview).

### 2. **Tableau Visualization**
The results of the analysis were visualized using Tableau, providing an interactive dashboard to display trends and insights. You can view the published Tableau Public dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/AERMCaseStudy_17417982431550/AEMRCaseStudy-EnsuringU_S_EnergyStability?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
