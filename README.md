# American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) Case Study

## Project Overview
This project is part of my Data Analytics course and involves analyzing energy trends and making data-driven decisions for the **American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR)**. In this project, I conducted an analysis of the energy market trends to address key concerns regarding energy stability, outages, and losses in the industry. Using SQL queries and Tableau for data visualization, I explored data to derive actionable insights that would help improve energy systems and regulatory frameworks. The project involved cleaning and processing data, generating reports, and visualizing key findings to support data-driven decisions in energy policy.

## Project Details

### Scenario Overview

The AEMR is tasked with ensuring the reliability of the United States’ domestic energy network. This includes monitoring and regulating energy outages. The case study focuses on analyzing outage types and understanding energy loss and market reliability.

### Objective

In this project, I’ve used SQL to analyze data, create visualizations in Tableau, and present key findings in a clear and actionable way. The primary focus areas are:
- **Energy Stability and Market Outages**
- **Energy Losses and Market Reliability**

### Key Insights and Visualizations
- **Energy Stability**: Trends in energy usage across various sectors and regions, identifying peak demand periods.
- **Outage Patterns**: Analysis of outage occurrences and their impact on the grid.
- **Energy Losses**: Understanding the correlation between energy loss and infrastructure aging, weather patterns, and other variables.
  
The final findings were summarized into an interactive Tableau dashboard, showcasing key metrics and insights from the analysis.

## Files Included
### 1. **SQL Analysis (Jupyter Notebook)**
The SQL queries for data analysis are provided in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file). These queries were used to process and analyze the raw energy market data. You can access and view the SQL notebook [here](https://anaconda.cloud/share/notebooks/32dd162e-93ac-4bb1-833c-3b5797cba54f/overview).

### 2. **Tableau Visualization**
The results of the analysis were visualized using Tableau, providing an interactive dashboard to display trends and insights. You can view the published Tableau Public dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/AERMCaseStudy_17417982431550/AEMRCaseStudy-EnsuringU_S_EnergyStability?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

## Tools Used
- **SQL** for data processing and analysis
- **Tableau Public** for data visualization and creating interactive dashboards
- **Jupyter Notebook** for organizing and documenting the SQL queries

### Note:
This project is hypothetical and designed as part of my Data Analytics coursework. The data and findings are not from a real-world job, but rather an educational exercise aimed at applying SQL and Tableau skills to a case study scenario.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my ability to use SQL for data extraction and analysis, Tableau for creating visualizations, and Jupyter Notebook for executing SQL queries. Through this case study, I gained hands-on experience in analyzing data, deriving actionable insights, and presenting findings in a clear and compelling way.
